# Kusaka Family

## Ryuunoshin's family
- Ryuunoshin's dad has been a Karou since Ryuunoshin was young.
- Ikkaku was hired by Ryuunoshin's dad to teach Ryuunoshin in sword fighting.
- Ikkaku lost to Ukon and quit teaching.
- Ryuunoshin actually rides horses with Daimyou and goes hunting with him.
- Tachibana has a son.
- Tachibana keeps trying to one up the Kusaka family (i.e. show that my family is better), and always pits his son against Ryuunoshin but his son always loses.
- Kusaka family doesn't directly try to appeal to Daimyou to say that Ryuunoshin is better (with the exception of the sword fighting competition). 
- Daimyou always listens to Inspector Tachibana's advises, especially when compared to other people like Ryuunoshin's dad or Jyuubei. A lot of the time it is ill advises like "go to the forest and rape Ryuunoshin's girl" and when that fails "forcefully buy her off her dad for castle work, and then rape her.".
- Ryuunoshin's mother and sister committed suicide to avoid being captured by Daimyou, slightly before the Kusaka family was attacked by the army. 

## Insignificant Grudge
1. Daimyou sees Ryuunoshin courting a girl, and Tachibana conspires with Daimyou in order to rape her. Twice.
2. Daimyou intentionally hides his face and goes with Tachibana and others to gang up on Ryuunoshin at night. Ryuunoshin, defending himself from his attackers who hid their faces, slashes his attacker. But it was revealed that the one he slashed was Daimyou himself. Even though Ryuunoshin was defending himself, they used this excuse to destroy the entire Kusaka family.
    * I think the family got destroyed because his dad tried to protect Ryuunoshin. But it could be just that Tachibana used his position and the excuse of Daimyou getting slashed by Ryuunoshin to destroy the entire family.
