# Events of Volume 3 (with regards to Spirited Away)

This has light spoilers for volume 3 and before. 

## Saesa

Saesa basically stalked Kamui because she fell in love with him. Stalked isn't really the most accurate term here, but that is what Kamui felt she was doing. 

Kamui is the only male who somewhat treats her differently from others, although I wouldn't say in a good way, but it isn't necessarily too horrible either. Almost like trying to care for a grumpy hedgehog and it keeps stabbing you.

## The point of Spiriting Away

There's two parts about this spirited away.

1. Yokome, by observing how Saesa talks and walks, he knows whether she is lying with regards matters concerning Kamui or not. 
2. This spirited awat sends Saesa on a wild goose chase so that she doesn't return home. This would make Yokome think that Saesa is still with Kamui. 

## Ultimately what helped Kamui get away

Kamui thinks that the spirited away move using the bamboo straw doll was what helped him get away from Shukudani (rather, Yokome, and possibly Kigisu). 

(Why Kigisu is involved is because Yokome could have sent Kigisu to find Saesa. )

Indirectly, it did, but what ultimately helped Kamui get away was the ninja (specifically the Wandering Monk who Kamui calls "Chief"), who basically warns Yokome with:

1. We have marked you. We are going to constantly watch you from now on.
2. You -as the Hinin head; are still useful to us, so we aren't killing you yet.
3. We operate with Danzaemon, and some orders are from Danzaemon himself.
4. The moment you stick your nose too far into a matter, we will kill you.

While Yokome was trying to figure out whether Kamui was with Saesa or not, whilst questioning Saesa what she is doing at the abandoned house (Tetsuzan's house), he realizes that he was this close to getting killed, stops questioning Saesa and backs off. 

Saesa -thinking that Ikkaku would know where Kamui is; was treating Ikkaku's fever (developed due to exhaustion). 

After finding Ikkaku, Saesa now returns to her house (Yokome's house) more frequently now. Which hints to Yokome that Kamui has disappeared again.
