# 忍 - Blade above one's Heart
To press a knife (刃) against one’s heart (心) such that
the heart is not pierced through. Even though the heart
may bleed profusely, the blade is never lifted up once.

In other words, this character represents
"enduring hardship" (i.e. perseverance).

Those who can not endure, pushes the knife into their own heart.

But for those who do endure, perhaps one day, one day
they will awaken and realize that: when the blades are
finally lifted up, and their hearts are finally set free.

## (added for entertainment value only)

There are some who persevere in their suffering, but
choose to wear their hearts not on sleeves but on blades.

Some call them:
忍びの者

In other words, Ninja.

## Notes:
* The word Ninja here is the western copy of the Japanese word that may have been influenced by stereotypes and tropes. (i.e. I added the line "Some call them: 忍びの者 In other words, Ninja." just to make it sound cool to English readers).
* Also I believe that the Kanji 忍 is added much later to the word しのび.
* This particular logogram is important because you can almost say that Kamui-den is about enduring hardship and thematically have people suiciding, and there are people who take up arms for emotion sake (i.e. wear heart on blade).
