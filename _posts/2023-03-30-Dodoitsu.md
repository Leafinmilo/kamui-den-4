Lyrics:

|Kanji| Hiragana|
|-|-|
|何をくよくよ| なにをよくよく|
|川端柳 | かわばたやなぎ |
|水の流れを|みずのながれを|
|知って散る|しってちる|

### Translation 1:
Direct translation
> Why do you cry, riverside willow.
When you learn which direction the water flows, you wither.

When talking about riverside willow, it is usually referring to weeping willow.

### Translation 2:
Some versions use 浮世 (うきよ) instead of 水の
Which can change the meaning to:
> Why do you cry, weeping willow.
When you learn about the transient world, you wither.

### Translation 3:
This isn't my version, but I was inspired by [someone else](https://ameblo.jp/luckydoor0803/entry-12695759171.html)
> Why do you cry, weeping willow. You are such in a good position right now. What you are antagonizing over, such things? One day you will realize what you are crying over is just water under the bridge. If you can realize that, then your sadness will disappear and you will be in peace.

This willow is found by the riverside. They are in advantageous position because they get more than enough water (rich) and is aesthetically pleasing to humans (beautiful).

But of course, this is likely talking about humans, rather than trees.

Or the [story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_too_shall_pass) goes.

King : "Oh wise man. If you are so wise, tell me a something that is appropriate for all times (i.e. any dynasty), can make the happy become sad, and the depressed rejoice?"

Wise man : "This too, shall pass."

### Translation 4:
However, with 浮世 (which can mean the world of the red light district), which makes it:
> Why do you cry, weeping willow.
Once you get used to the world of prostitution, your beauty withers.

Where weeping willow is used to describe a beautiful woman, crying.

This translation could suggest that it is about a woman being forced into prostitution.
Alternatively, a prostitute is only beautiful when she hasn't been in the world of prostitution for a long time.

For example, this could be talking about entertainers similar to Geisha. They (for some, unwillingly) give up their former life (hence weep) and are beautiful when they first debut, but after awhile, they lose their charm.

### My version:
If you put away the fact that "my dear" refers to a female who is not your wife and usually an entertainer who you find beautiful.
> Why do you cry, my dear. If you get caught up with the sadness of it all, your beauty will fade.

Basically: I would rather see you smile than to be sad, don't worry, the sadness you are facing shall pass one day.


## 恋に焦がれて - Burnt by the passions of love

(Well, some people are really scared of insects, so I won't add an image here.)

[Example video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR129VOiqo0)
or [another (second half)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMkeQlfNVE0)

The Kanji here is given by Sanpei Shirato.

|Kanji| Hiragana|
|-|-|
|恋に焦がれて| こいにこがれて|
|鳴く蝉よりも| なくせみよりも|
|鳴かぬ蛍が|　なかぬほたるが|
|身を焦がす|　みをこがす|

### Translation:
To translate it this way to English, you need to flip the order of the text.
> The silent fireflies burn more brightly, then the passion between two noisy cicadas.

Which is sometimes taken to mean:
> The man who loves you patiently, is far better than the one who is noisy, flirts and chases after you. The noisy man doesn't love you.

Generally associated to be that the noisy man is the one who is only after your looks.

Or, in other words, don't fall for man who is described in songs such as `Betty Hutton – It's A Man` and `Betty Hutton - He's A Demon, He's A Devil, He's A Doll` and `Ella Fitzgerald - Undecided`.

### My version:
> The silent fireflies burn more passionately, than the (noisy) cicadas mating on the trees.

### Side note:

You would kinda only appreciate this if you look at cicadas, fireflies and their mating rituals.

## あざがでるほど - Till a bruise forms

(I've no idea what image to put here haha... )

I can't find a video where someone sings this song.
But the Kanji here is given by Sanpei Shirato.

|Kanji| Hiragana|
|-|-|
|あざがでるほど|あざがでるほど|
|つねってみたが|つねってみたが|
|色がくろくて|いろがくろくて|
|わからない|わからない|

### Translation 1:
Direct translation
> I tried to pinch my skin so that it bruised, but the color (of my skin) was too dark, so I couldn't tell.

### Translation 2:
色 in poetry (i.e. such as in Iroha Poem) or doesn't always mean color.
It can mean flowers, beautiful woman, or pleasures in life (usually Eros).

くろくて here can mean evil, sin.

Which makes it
> I tried to pinch my skin to see if it was a dream, but the lure of having sex with another woman (who is not my wife), I don't know if I want to wake up from it.

### My version:
> I tried to bruise my skin to see if it was a dream, (but) buried between your blossom, I couldn't see.

Which suggests you are already embracing the other, and double checking if you are dreaming about it. Yet you ain't running away, and perhaps in denial in order to hide the guilt that this is even happening.
