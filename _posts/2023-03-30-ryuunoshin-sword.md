## Introduction.
It is possible to call Ryuunoshin's family sword as a long sword, however, when considering the actual word used, it could be a lot more complicated than that.

## Actual word used.
In page 28-29, Sanpei Shirato used the words 長刀.

This is interesting because to my knowledge there is no Japanese weapon of that exact shape with that name. And he specifically has Kamui call this as 長刀 twice despite being able to use a different word. (i.e. why not call it Uchigatana?)

In Edo period, 長刀 can refer to Naginata. However, it is likely not pronounced as Naginata (Furigana wasn't given) because the sequence of events literally showed Atena with a Naginata. And Sanpei Shirato uses Hiragana to address Atena's weapon.

## Is it a Japanese Blade?
### What is 刀?
It is important to note that the 刀 means "blade" in the Japanese language, specifically a single edged blade. Linguistically, it doesn't refer to any particular sword and it can also refer to knives.

In the same way sword is a generic word for Sword, and it does not refer to any specific kind of sword. For example, all of these are swords, but they do not replace the word sword: Spadone, Epee, Gladius, Kris, Messer ("knife").

### What is a Katana?

Some readers might be puzzled by this duplicated header as 刀 is pronounced (in this context) as かたな (Katana).

It is important to make the distinction here and now that the modern language turned Katana to mean a specific kind of Japanese sword of certain length and of certain materials.

And really, the modern usage of the word Katana can also refer to a classification of swords, rather than a specific sword. 

The same way a generic drawing of a smartphone sterotypically tend to be an iPhone. 

### Japanese Blade Classification

Not to be confused by the wearing of two swords (Daishou), this is specifically talking about sizes. 

To my knowledge, the Japanese never classified sword with 長. They classified swords with 大 and 小, and sometimes called swords based on their purposes.

* 小 (small): Less than 2 Shaku (尺) in length (<2)
* 大 (big): More than or Equals to 2 Shaku (尺) in length (>=2)

It is worth nothing that the Shaku (尺) is only standardized more recently in history. During the Edo period, the Japanese utilized the Chinese's units of measurement including Chi (尺), but I believe it varies slightly from the Chinese. Also the Chinese Chi varied within China.

As a side note, I feel is slightly problematic to classify Japanese swords as "short" and "long", because people it who do not study such weapons might -especially if you have seen European weapons in any form (in games, as decorations, in movies etc); have the wrong impression that I would be mentioning in the next paragraph..

Because the modern Katana's blade length is approximately 2 Shaku in length, and if we say 大 is "long" then it makes a Katana a "long" sword. However, the word "long" in the English word sense invokes the idea that the Katana is on the same wavelength as a "One-and-a-half" sword or even a Zweihander, despite the Katana having a blade length roughly the same or has even shorter than an "arming" sword.

### Is it just Naginata with a sword handle?

Since, the Kanji 長刀 sometimes refered to Naginata.

It is possible to consider then, that the family sword is a Naginata blade attached to a sword handle. But is it so?

A side note: Naginata's blade curvature at the tip changes depending on the time period and who made the weapon.

#### Nagamaki 長巻

![Nagamaki](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Antique_shinto_samurai_nagamaki_1.jpg/375px-Antique_shinto_samurai_nagamaki_1.jpg)

(An antique Nagamaki. Image Source: [Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Antique_shinto_samurai_nagamaki_1.jpg/375px-Antique_shinto_samurai_nagamaki_1.jpg))

There is a weapon of similar description of something like a Naginata blade on a sword handle, and it is called [Nagamaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagamaki).

I will acknowledge however, that Nagamaki is accepted by some to be Oodachi blade instead of a Naginata blade. That is: A Nagamaki could have originate from Oodachi that progressively had more and more wrappings to make it more wieldy (as seen above).

But, you have to acknowledge that the characteristic of a Oodachi -basically a bigger Tachi; is that even the tang is curved (like above's example). So the straightness of the handle of Ryuunoshin's family sword is a little challenging.

And, the Nagamaki was featured in previous volumes, so it is not likely that Ryuunoshin's sword is a Nagamaki.

#### Naginata Naoshi 薙刀直し

The Japanese swords were detachable from their handles, so you could technically trivially swap the handles out. It is entirely possible to retrofit a Naginata to a sword handle because the Naginata's tang is relatively straight and some variants of Naginata were more sword like. 

While it is possible to just attach a Naginata blade to a sword handle, it is also entirely possible, that [Naginata Naoshi](https://www.meihaku.jp/ginga-sword/ginga-naoshi/) was performed.

This is the process of cutting the tang to retrofit it onto a regular sword handle. 

Again, you can argue that you could cut a Oodachi's tang if the curvature is the issue. 

## Is it a Chinese Blade?
### What is 刀?
It is important to note that the 刀 means "blade" in the Chinese language, specifically a single edged blade. It doesn't refer to any particular sword and it can also refer to knives.

Though, when talking about weapons, 刀 tend to invoke a certain shape of weapon, primarily what Wushu practictioners would use (which is essentially a fatter head version of the Liuye dao). 

![Wushu Dao](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Wushu_dao.jpg)

(Image Source: [Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Wushu_dao.jpg))

More importantly, the Chinese referred to swords that are two edged as 剑 (Jian). So 刀 really meant single edged blade.

### Chang Dao 長刀
The Chinese had a weapon called 長刀, although before I discuss about it, I would like to talk about a different weapon first.

Here is an example of [Chang Dao](https://www.mandarinmansion.com/item/antique-changdao) from Mandarin Mansion Antiques.

### Miao Dao 苗刀

Miao Dao might be a more modern term for this weapon, but the reason why I want to talk about this weapon, is because it is probably more familiar to most people.

The Miao Dao is often attributed to be the descendent of 長刀.

However, this is problematic when you consider Kamui's height relative to the size of a Miao Dao.

For an example of a Miao Dao, you can see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2mBMklLSpA) from Matt Easton of Scholagladitoria who reviews a Miao Dao made by LK Chen. (His mannerism at the start of the video is in attempt to please the youtube algorithms.)

### Dan Dao Fa Xuan (單刀法選)'s 長刀

The manufacturing of 長刀 is sometimes attributed to Dan Dao Fa Xuan. This treaties is written in the late Ming dynasty (early Edo period).

There is two ways to view the word 單刀
1. Refers to swords of Japanese origin or Imitations of Japanese swords.
2. It is a class of single edged blade weapons that required you to use two hands. Which means  you couldn't use a shield. 

When this treaties was written, the Chinese did not know how the Japanese made their swords. That is, their metal technologies were different.

Therefore, when we look at the Miao Dao, once you look beyond just the shape of the sword, and examine how the sword is manufactured, how the tang is pinned to the handle, the tip of the blade (i.e. the Kissaki), the spine and the metal used, you can see it is a really different sword from the Japanese katana.

In Dan Dao Fa Xuan the author describes seizing a sword from the Japanese and measured the total length to be five Chi (尺), with the blade length being three Chi eight Chun (三尺八寸). It is important to note, that the Japanese do call the Oodachi the five Shaku (尺) katana.

Both Chinese and Japanese take a 寸 to be 1/10th of their respective 尺.

The author then describes that in order to manufacture this sword to be usable by crossbowmen, a shorter variant should be made to have an total length of three Chi seven Chun (三尺七寸) with the blade length being two Chi eight Chun (二尺八寸). (note that the total length, is the blade length of the normal variant).

This variant of the 長刀 is known as the Crossbowmen's Dao in the HEMA community.

For an example of a Crossbowmen's Dao, you can see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JYE9KDTyMA) from Matt Easton of Scholagladitoria who reviews the Crossbowmen's Dao made by LK Chen. (His mannerism at the start of the video is in attempt to please the youtube algorithms.)

Here is an example of a [Ming Dan Dao](https://www.mandarinmansion.com/item/ming-dandao) from Mandarin Mansion Antiques. I would like to think it reminds me of a Naginata head.

#### Side note about the Chinese 尺
One problematic thing about the historical Chinese 尺 is that it is not always consistent, and that different jobs had different types of 尺.

That means, we don't know which 尺 did the author meant to use, nor what 尺 was used by those who read the text and looked at the drawing to manufacture the weapon.

Some examples are:
- 周尺 which is some kind of standardized 尺
- 营造尺 which is the carpenter's 尺

And that unlike today where it is possible to verify that a meter means a meter, it is not so in the past, and there were slightly more variants in their 尺 despite standardizing them.

This would make the 長刀 to be either long, or too long to the point that it is almost unwieldy.

## Theories / TLDR

### Theory 1 - Ryuunoshin's family sword is a Chinese sword.
Therefore, one theory is that Ryuunoshin's family sword is the Crossbowmen Dao.

A sword with a blade length of the Chinese 二尺八寸, would, when measured by the Japanese, would classify this 刀 to be towards the longer end of a 大 blade.

And it is really impractical to wear a proper sized Chinese 長刀 or a Oodachi on your hips.

Basically if this theory is right, whilst it can be translated as a "long sword", it is not of Japanese origin.

#### Implications
1. Someone hired a Chinese blacksmith to make this weapon specifically for the Kusaka family. Which would make it a slightly weird
2. It is likely classified as a family sword to fall into the exceptions set by the Tokugawa. The Tokugawa banned swords that are longer than 三尺 except those used for Ceremonial purposes or are part of a Daimyo's treasury.

### Theory 2 - It's a Naginata that underwent Naginata Naoshi
As mentioned, it could be a Naginata Naoshi.

#### Implications
1. The blacksmith performing this change just needed to make a Tsuba with the Kusaka family on it.
2. Then, if some ancestor used this Naginata to fight on the battle field, it could make some sense that it became a family heirloom to be passed down.

However, I do not know if the Japanese called swords made from the Naginata Naoshi process as a 長刀.

# But it's just a Theory

Since volume 2 just calls the author just calls it 刀 in author's notes. 

Though, Kamui, when he was younger, when he attaches a knife onto a wooden pole, he calls it a 刀.

And Ryunoshin's sword is a sword which Kamui -when he was younger; could have worn on his back and drew out from it. 

I digress, but regarding wearing sword on the back:

Drawing from your back is not impossible as demonstrated by:
- [HEMA Youtuber Metatron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj-BulImoEQ) who draws from the back, albeit the scabbard is not actually attached to his back.
    - To digress even more:
        - This method has been proposed as to how people could have drew Odachi from the hip, although that would be a two person process.
        - I do recall hearing pulling the sheath being a method that some Iaido practitioners use perform quick draw. (Or as the 22nd headmaster of Kobudo Asayama Ichiden Ryu calls it: ["pulling the sheath and putting it back"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b46UWHS3WmI).)

And also alternatives to back scabbards:
- [HEMA Youtuber Shadiversity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EWi2DnDoaI) who tries to address the problem by designing a different scabbard for a European sword.
- [HEMA Youtuber Scholagladitoria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwdwLcYCf7o) who talks about how the Burmese wore their swords (in his example, the Dha he shows is about 2 Shaku or shorter).
