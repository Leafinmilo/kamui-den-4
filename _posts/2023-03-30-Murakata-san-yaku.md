# Forward
In Edo Period, there is this thing known as 村方三役

As of writing this, I don't know how long this lasted, but this is the general structure.

# General structure

Murakata San Yaku, basically means the Three Village Role.

The roles of in the Headman, Group Head and Peasant Representative is mostly done by elections.

## Magistrate
The magistrate is not part of the Murakata San Yaku.

However, whatever instructions they receive from above, is passed down. 

## Headman (名主 / 庄屋)

Primary job scope:
1. Take care of the annual tax by ensuring it is paid
2. Maintaining village roads (paid by Forced Labor Remuneration)
3. Maintaining the family register of the village
4. Care for villagers
5. Issuing of passports

Passports were needed to cross borders where checkpoints existed. The nuance of who needs it and for what purposes will not be discussed here. 

The Headman is the most important person in the village. 

In Kamui-den, he also ensures that the Samurai are well taken care of when they visit the village for Inspection or for hunting. 

## Group Head (組頭)

Primary Job scope:
1. Assist the headman

Now based on the name of this role, you would assume that it has to be the head of the group of five. For that I am not sure, but I know that this role exists to help the village head.

## Peasant Representative (百姓代)

Primary Job scope:
1. Ensure that the headman and group head are handling things fairly.
2. To ensure that 小百姓 (small peasant)'s concerns are also heard

## Group of Five (五人組)

This makes up the bulk of the people. 

Primary Job scope:
1. Watch the other members to ensure that they are not committing any crimes
2. Ensure that the group is able to pay up the tax
    * This can involve helping them with their fields if they fall sick

Group of five is not an elected position, but just grouping Peasants together. This could be done by selecting those who are of close proximity.

However, I would imagine that if the group purely contained farmers who is poor, then for sure they would not be able to raise enough money.

So I assume that the group may contain a mixed combination of poor and rich, just to ensure the the group will last (poor + rich + medium people = if no reach KPI, the rich pay more. )

# Notes

1. Is group head higher rank than representative? I don't know.
2. This is applicable for villages and not towns (perhaps even applicable to farming villages only)
3. Sure, you can say that what is below Peasant Representative is True Peasants (本百姓), but generally they are grouped in fives.
