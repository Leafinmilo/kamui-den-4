# About
Kamui Den is a series of Manga is written by Sanpei Shirato with the first volume being published in 1964.

The manga is set after 1660 within Kansai / Chubu and follows Kamui, a Shinobi no Mono (i.e. Ninja), and other various characters who observe the issues with the nature of the Tokugawa system (Edo period / late Ming dynasty).

Volume 4 is the start of the series where more of the issues are being realized and discussed, and is a good starting point as discourse for studying various ideology shared by the author.

However, volume 4 does reference previous chapters and reading it would allow you to understand the picture with better clarity than just volume 4.
