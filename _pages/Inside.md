# What is this section about

This is just a page where I am typing some commentary for Manga.

Please do not use what is written here to quote as evidence for academic studies.

# Contents
You can ignore comments with ♫, but sometimes it's nice to read manga with music.

|Page| Comment |
|-|-|
|10 | The wall writes 剣一字, which I don't think has a meaning (besides saying: "One word, sword."). I think it would be better to have been 剣一学, which would mean swordsmanship. |
|11 | Yagyuu is a pretty big name. Go look up Yagyuu clan. |
|13 | It is worth nothing that Fuuketsubo is a monk. And that the patterned cloth which wraps around his neck and is attached to his waist, has a very similar pattern to the monk who went to Atena's Dad's (Tetsuzan) house. |
|13 | That patterned cloth is also very similar to the monk who was observing Kamui's skills in Volume 1 pg 243. |
|13 | 無想流 (Musouryuu) literally means "Head empty no thoughts" style which is a different word from 夢想流. Which is why Tesshin insults him by calling him weak headed monk. |
|20 | It is worth revealing that Atena's dad (Tetsuzan) knew about Shinobi no mono and likely Atena did too. |
|20 | That Ryuunoshin and Atena is talking about different things. Ryuunoshin thinks she is talking about feelings, but Atena isn't. This to contrast how Ryuunoshin and Atena don't think alike. |
|22 | One example of Originality, you can see Sega's Yakuza Series (`Ryuu ga Gotoku`) where characters learn Original skills through Revelations. |
|27 | Kamui actually attempted the unpolished version of this skill once on Ikkaku. |
|27 | Atena is able to say this because she has watched Kamui train with Ikkaku at Tetsuzan's house. |
|28 | [Ryuunoshin's Family Sword]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2023-03-30-ryuunoshin-sword %}) |
|28 | Kasumi Kiri, Misty blade. It is worth nothing that the full name of Kasumi Kiri would hint that it is a skill that involves drawing the sword from the sheath. |
|29 | The reason why Ryuunoshin says "so you are the one who saved me", is because he vaguely remembers someone saving him and calls himself Kamui of Shukudani (could be Kamui's twin brother). But when he tries to ask Kamui about it, he doesn't say a thing. |
|32 | I don't know why Akame is called Akame, but it could be because his eyes are red (i.e. like `Akame` from `Akame ga Kiru`). |
|32 | That's Tetsuzan (Atena's Dad). Kamui's was knocked out after fighting with a Ninja and lost. |
|32 | The coral ring (サンゴ玉) is one of the seven treasures of Buddhism. |
|32 | The effects of this spirited away is actually shown in previous volumes (specifically spirited away occurs at vol 3 196). Basically because Saesa kept stalking Kamui, he spirited away himself to make Saesa think he is really taken away by a bird. Though, ultimately what helped him escape the Hinin village was not this. [spoiler]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2023-03-30-spirited-away %}) |
|32 | ♫ `Ally Kerr - The Sore Feet Song` |
|34 | It is worth nothing that the Wandering Monk (Chief) probably thought that Kamui managed fake beheading. |
|34 | Here, the garb this wandering monk is wearing, is that of Japanese Zen Buddhism. You can google "Unsui Monks" or for a similar but different but more famous type of wandering monk: "Komuso". |
|35 | The people here call Kamui arrogant because they recognize that he is a Hinin. |
|37 | ♫ `Nujabes - Battle Cry` |
|42 | It is worth nothing that although Akame says that he needs to fight for real, he doesn't seem to outsmart Kamui or even come close to beating him completely. |
|56 | Here they are talking about how Kamui managed to survive five days without food and limited water whilst hiding in the grass. |
|56 | Iga is pretty far from Osaka. |
|61 | This scene is designed to reflect Ryuunoshin's state of mind, where interpreting meanings in randomness ([pareidolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia) or [Apophenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia)) kept leading him to think about his dad. |
|61 | Weasel Drop is written with the words 飯綱. 飯綱 is a kindred spirit fox that can fit into a bamboo tube, like the one Kamui is using to help him breath whilst underwater. |
|62 | I don't know why Atena tried to stop him. But she does know about Ryuunoshin's background and current status. |
|64 | This is the first time Ikkaku, Atena and Saesa met in a long while. The last time they met was slightly before Kamui wakes up in the flashback shown in 32. |
|64 | Ukon presumably asks Atena if she is Tetsuzan's daughter.|
|65 | This scene doesn't make sense if you don't know the relationship between Hinin and local Hinin head and Danzaemon. Basically all Hinin must obey Hinin head. |
|65 | Also it is important to note that Yokome does work for Inspector Tachibana. |
|76 | Here it is important to note that they are just literally days before harvest. Trashing the fields is really bad. |
|71 | It is worth nothing that the Samurai Koheita is riding a horse in the presence of two other Samurai. Also this scene really serves to contrast Koheita's nature from other Samurai. |
|82 | If you want to have an idea of what the Samurai eats as described by the author's notes and how a Ryo looks like and it's worth, it is worth watching `REVENGERS` animated by `Ajia-do Animation Works` to see Raizo's meals and the depictions of Ryo as a currency (and not the plot device). Though do take the depictions of religions by that show with a pinch of salt. |
|82 | The thing that the man is doing here is [Uchimizu](https://uchimizu.jp/en/), which is the scattering of clean water. And it also hints that the Burei-uchi (cutting down people for offending Samurai) is acceptable near Hioki castle.|
|83 | Please really pay attention to Koheita's wife's clothes, the holes in the windows and the blanket. |
|83 | The untranslated text at the bottom is [iroha poem]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2023-03-30-Iroha %}).|
|84 | Here you can observe some rules and traditions regarding the Samurai. No one else except Tachibana is on horseback. |
|84 | ♫ `Keiichi Okabe - Wretched Weaponry` |
|87 | It is worth nothing that Jyuubei thought that Ikkaku has already met Ryuunoshin and told him the events of volume 3. |
|88 | Kusaka family's relationship with Daimyou [(spoilers)]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2023-03-30-Kusaka-family %}) |
|89 | These type of (throwing) knives is known as Kodzuka. |
|90 | If you have ever thrown a knife or axe, you'll know how difficult it is to be able to judge the distance and put enough force to ensure that the tip sticks into the target. It's even worse for throwing swords (which uses a different throwing technique). |
|94 | Ryuunoshin wasn't able to recognize Kamui due to his focus, but realizes immediately because Kamui has revealed his identity to Ryuunoshin whilst wearing the scarf when they first met at Tetsujin dojo. |
|95 | Yokome (who is not a ninja) also used caltrops in volume 3. |
|95 | Despite training Kamui, Ikkaku doesn't realize who the hooded person is until 97. But of course, he was busy fighting and dodging. |
|101| Ukon has been constantly looking for Yokome to fight him again ever since Yokome defeated him and took away his leg. |
|103| Sanpei Shirato not only drew the entire process of Inspection but also wrote at least 1000 words essay to explain it further, this is why there is no TLDR. |
|103| Here it isn't clear why Inspection isn't doing anything to help. It could be just the Samurai choose to accept the bribe and not do anything, or it could be because the Hanamaki Village Headman has been adjusting the book slightly. |
|103| Here there is a [village politics system]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2023-03-30-Murakata-san-yaku %}) that is not explained. |
|104| Shousuke only taught the kids using what limited education he has and from books. It is worth nothing that Shousuke taught them Hiragana through [iroha poem]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2023-03-30-Iroha %}). |
|105| Aside from trying to escape from Genin, I really don't know why Shousuke is trying to undermine the Headman, other than to show that the Headman is being manipulative despite appearing to be good for all. |
|105| One interesting fact about the 'there are people who are literate too', is that in previous chapters other village did the same thing, and had a bad ending. |
|111| The word "Difficult job" actually implies "dirty" or "sinful" |
|111| Kamui has killed people before. But not kids and women. |
|112| This scene does not make sense unless you read section at 132 and 198, where you learn that they have submitted a [request for revenge]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2023-03-30-Revenge %}).|
|116| The question about why he is helping Ryuunoshin and Ikkaku is a good one. Before Kamui became a ninja, he was always just trying to beat people up and wouldn't stop until he won, so this question is asked with the expectation that you read the previous ones.. |
|129| Ikkaku attempts to fight Kamui because he has always won every sword fight against Kamui. |
|131| The role of a [Castle Caretaker]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2023-03-30-Ranks %}) is given to a Karou.  |
132| Insignificant Grudge [(spoilers)]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2023-03-30-Kusaka-family %}) |
133| Was Koheita the one who actually captured that pheasant?
133| The reason why they are asking if they can [assist with the revenge...]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2023-03-30-Revenge %}) |
|134| Remember that Tachibana Guntayu is Inspector. He knows the laws of the land and how to best jump through loopholes.|
|136| If we were to modernize this, Daimyou might actually call them terrorists. |
|138| Ikkaku has actually met this wandering monk ("chief") before, whether he realizes this or not, I don't know since he doesn't ask the monk to identify himself. |
|137| ♫`Tell Me Why - Penpals` |
|139| It is worth nothing that this is a word play. "Are you able to walk" because you are exhausted, and whether you can become a Hinin or not. |
|139| It's also worth pointing out that Ikkaku trained Ryuunoshin in swordsmanship. For some reason he is very fond of going out of his way to help Ryuunoshin. |
|141| There's a population registry for Hinin, to ensure that the Samurai can keep tabs on how many Hinin there are. |
|141| Yasuke knew the implication right away. |
|143| Them talking about Tengu is interesting, it's worth looking up the various messages surrounding the Tengu (race?) do. |
|143| For a murderer, that's very little blood. |
|146| Worth remembering what 1 Ryo is worth. |
|146| This man is somehow lecturing the two of them and is giving Shousuke life advice. Despite appearing to be threatening them. |
|147| If you haven't caught on, it's a plan made up by Village Headman with Shibutare coordinating. |
|150| I'm assuming he actually recognizes Kokemaru. Might not be true. |
|154| The dismissal of the Samurai is a lot a lot more sinister. Basically, I hire you to be a soldier, I stop giving you any tasks that involves being a soldier, and then I fire you for under the excuse of "you are not doing your job" when I am the one who never give you any task. |
|154| Tachibana is the one who came up with this plan. As seen in 133. Even Daimyou was shocked. |
|155| ♫`Skeeter Davis - The End of The World ` or ♫`The Ink Spots - It's All Over But The Crying`|
|156| It is not mentioned whether this longhouse only contained lower ranking Samurai, but it is likely that they all were. For an example, you can look up [Ashigaru Nagaya](https://www.jcastle.info/view/Shibata_Ashigaru_Nagaya) at Shibata City. Or [Choshu Nishike](https://www.jcastle.info/view/Choshu_Nishi-ke_Nagaya). Technically it is better to translate them to rowhouses for the most accurate English meaning, because longhouse it's own meaning in English. |
|156| The untranslated text in the room is [iroha poem]({% post_url 2023-03-30-Iroha %}).|
|159| "I won't be able to face my ancestors" is an interesting contrast for later at 231.|
|160| He lit an incense for his ancestors. |
|160| The reason why Ikkaku knows that information is because he want to confront Jyuubei in the previous volume. |
|160| (viewer caution is advised) As an example for tanning, You can see Portage College's ["Hide Tanning The Traditional 13 Steps"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw50DFNQveQ)
|161| Sanpei Shirato doesn't draw the Pasture as he did in the previous volumes. But, "The Pasture" here refers to dedicated location within or very near to villages. All dead body, including humans, are disposed here (Including Omine's body). |
|161| This is why the villagers can immediately appear before them to annoy them. Because it's literally beside the villages. |
|161| The Kanji for "The Pasture" can -but it doesn't in this case; refer to the grass fields that Peasants would go to gather grass for working animals or fertilizers. This exact Kanji was refered to those fields in previous volumes. |
|162| (viewer caution is advised) you can look up "[Running Wild With Bear Grylls S4E1 - Joseph Gordon-Levitt Unexpectedly Runs Into A Huge Crocodile!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfEiF9XqHUI)" for how this looks like.
|163| ♫ `Tenohira wo Taiyou ni` (If you can't find one, [you can listen to this version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTW622naC3Y))|
|164| 82 is really to serve contrast to the bucket thrown here. |
|170| 不仅要甘心勉强自己，还要勉强自己甘心 |
|171| ♫ `Joan Baez - Donna, Donna`|
|180| Grace is difficult to explain here. Would be better to watch `Ascendance of a Bookworm` Season 1 EP 17 after `Lutz` lashes out at `Gil`. `Flan` explains what `Grace` means in their context, but is also applicable here.  |
|181| I can't help but to feel that Kokemaru's "I have a dream" part was inspired by the words of `Martin Luther King Jr.` "every valley shall be exalted and every hill made low". |
|186| It is worth noting that this is not the first time Ryuunoshin has seen Omine's skull. The first time would be V2 P64. |
|187| Literally `駆逐してやる この世から 一匹残らず` (i.e. That Eren Jaeger line).|
|188| Trope: Lightning flashing behind the enemy . |
|190| The chief headman (or so I call him) actually is warning them so that they don't get arrested. |
|191| Shousuke learnt how to read and write at Chikumazawa Village Headman's house when Ijuin visited. Shousuke happened to be there because he was delivering a letter from Hanamaki Village Headman. |
|193| While it is not possible to say that Ryuunoshin talking about the domino effect, or a tower of cards collapsing on itself. But it is clear that his words was in response to looking at Koroku. The last time he saw Koroku was when he was sane and Omine was still alive. |
|195| Village Headman is really sly, making him accept an offer before saying that oh "I forgot to mention". |
|195| Just a reminder, the Headman gave his ledger to the Peasants, so he takes Shousuke's copy of that ledger. |
|196| Japanese language doesn't differentiate between copy and copies, it would make sense for the Village Headman to suspect that he made copies, but I don't know where Shousuke would get the paper from. |
|200| ♫ `Shinsekai Yori - Traditional Song of Shadows (Part 1)` or you can listen to the whole thing.  |
|200| I don't know what is written on the letter. |
|201| 喰葉根(Kuwane) is such an interesting name. Read as Eat/Food Leaf Root, but pronounced the same way as "can't / don't eat". |
|204| The sound effect here literally says that he floated to the pole, not even a thud from the shoe. |
|217| The title of this chapter is a little more complex than just saying '[sacrificial lamb]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2023-03-30-Sacrificial-Lamb %})', but is sufficient. |
|217| ♫ `Mary Hopkin - Those Were the Days`| 
|220| Meager life here actually is dual meaning. 1. Economically poor. 2. Very boring. |
|228| To put into context, Akame kept trying to appeal to them that she is an adult unlike the rest and talked about how behaving so and so means you are an adult. And the girls do look up to her as a bigger sister. |
|228| Akame is somewhat interested in Shousuke because he is the only one who is doing something interesting and is the boy who does not look at her with lustful eyes, despite intentionally appearing naked before him. |
|231| "I won't be able to face my ancestors" is an interesting contrast for 159. |
|250| Sometimes I really find the lack of onomatopoeia in the English language to be slightly annoying. |
|250| Look at how the Samurai measure rice. They intentionally waste the rice by dropping it onto the floor so that the Peasants present less tax than what was actually brought over. |
|270| KATAME practicality raised KAMUI by providing food, hunting in pairs and journeying together. |
|274| I believe the footprints belong to the individual in 278. |
|274| The statement uttered by Shousuke in 304 is somewhat problematic. |
|275| Note the existing pots and food storage. This means that people do come here pretty often and probably shared some resources here. |
|277| Yokome is very careful when it comes to the topic of Ninja because they threatened to kill him if he talked to others about them. |
|278| No that individual is not Akame. It's probably a character from Volume 2 (to not spoil you, not gonna mention the name). I'm more surprised that Saesa doesn't recognize him, but maybe his voice changed due to puberty or something. |
|279| Food was washed away. |
|280| [Indentured Service]({ % post_url 2023-03-30-Genin % }). |
|282| I can't tell if Sanpei Shirato intended the headman to say that out loud. |
|283| We don't actually get to see Shousuke's mom with the exception of volume 3 which explains who she was.|
|283| ♫`Suara - Musouka` |
|286| You can see [Primitive Technology: Reusable charcoal mound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjK2XlNE39Q) for an idea how this could look like. |
|289| For an example of a complete novice doing blacksmithing, see [Tom Scott learning blacksmithing from Alec Steele](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2HUg144liM) .|
|290| I don't know who would be interested in this information, but he uses the word Hagane rather than Tamahagane. |
|291| For example of how ploughing works, you can see `Vinland Saga season 2` (all events before episode 10)|
|298| By "horrible", he is saying: Shousuke's friend (Kokemaru) isn't just loud, scary and very strong, but is also a Hinin. |
|299| The Batman slap. |
|301| I find it hard that Kokemaru will leave Shousuke here alone without food. So I guesstimate based off what Yokome told the people, Kokemaru would return within a week or so. |
|304| Although 1里 was defined during Toyotomi Hideyoshi time to be 36町 which is about 3.92 km, Meiji era defines it to be a walkable distance within one hour and set it to 4km (Which I can confirm that average). The Chinese's 1里 in the late ming dynasty (early edo) is about 500 meters. |
|304| 39 km is also a very long distance (that's about straight line distance from Singapore's Changi Airport to Tuas Link station. To give you an idea, the SAF Basic Military Training (BMT) Pass Out Parade (POP) road march is approximately 24 Km). For four people to carry Yokome on a bed over (274), much less for Kokemaru to travel whilst carrying Shousuke and just casually going over (306), makes 39 Km slightly unbelievable. |
|304| Therefore I believe that the 1里 here is closer to the Chinese's value, which is about 500 meters. Making 10 里 become 5 km (3.1 mi). Though, I don't really know if 5 km would cause Nana's feet would bleed, but the road might be rough. |
|311| [Guntayu]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2023-03-30-Ranks %}). |
|317| Worth nothing that Ukon has seen someone a kid hiding on a tree wearing a headscarf and animal clothing (Kamui) who was oozing out bloodlust. But he doesn't how Kamui actually looks like.|
|317| Remember Kuji yaku? The discussion about Inu gin? That is why Kamui went to stop the dogs from moving.|
|317| Also, the soldiers don't recognize Kamui for some reason, even though he is the only one wearing animal skin. I will acknowledge however, that these are probably new troops that Tachibana hired to replace the ones that were fired. |
|331| The word in Mandarin would suggest that it is a lamp. However I believe it's the oil for Eternal Fire / Eternal Light. |
|340| In Edo period, Totteshan is a slang word for beautiful women. |
|341| These are all [Dodoitsu]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2023-03-30-Dodoitsu %}). |
|343| Likely blow darts. |
|345| I believe that is water reserved for fire fighting. |
|345| The guy is leaving the shop, perhaps even sneaking out of the shop. |
|346| Yet another slang is used here. Also the word might be an entertainer girl he fancied, but most likely he is talking about his wife. |
|349| See Ofuku Okame. |
|352| A vagrant in Edo period are people who are not included within the normal population census and family register. this means they don't account for tax. They don't have fixed residences nor a fixed job. Some vagrants would end up becoming Hinin. |
|352| Crossing the [border](https://www.hakonesekisyo.jp/db/data_inc/inc_frame/fr_data_01_01.html). |
|353| The issue of being not associated with a family (i.e. Vagrant) issue was pretty rampant in Edo period that the government had to step in. |
|354| In some places in Japan, during the Edo period, [Tattoo](http://www.edojidai.info/kurashi/zaininn-irezumi.html) was used to mark that someone has been to prison before. For example, you can draw on the person progressing from 一 ナ 大 to 犬 to show that he has been in prison multiple times. But it is more likely lines drawn on the arm. |
|354| The best way to identify who Akame is, is to observe the clothes, not his eyes. Slightly non-consistent but, he is the only one wearing white with a crosshatching pattern at the top. |
|354| There's lots of ways to read the word Kamidani, alternative reading is Tamiya, Uetani, Kamitani. But for Dani would be good because because Shukudani. |
|355| Sanpei Shirato is largely writing this prison based off [伝馬町牢屋敷](https://chuoku-machikadotenjikan.jp/tenjikan/royashiki/). |
|355| Tsuru is written with Katakana (ツル). Some people believe it is 蔓 which makes it vine of life. For example in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imNscq0RqHE). |
|357| The board they are using to whack is called Kime board. Which can be anywhere from 3-5 寸 thick and 二尺五寸 long. (1 寸 is 1/10th of a 尺. A 尺 modernized to be 30 cm/11.81 in)|
|360| To understand why it is called hell entering ceremony, you need to understand the alternate words used for prison, which are 牢獄 and 監獄. But to understand those, 地獄 is the ideogram for hell, which is the land of 獄, where 獄 contains the idea of Sinner. Interestingly for 獄, the radicals are dog on the left (犭) is barking (言) at dog on the right (犬). |
