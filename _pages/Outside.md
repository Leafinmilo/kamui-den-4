To understand the idea of Shinobi no Mono, it is worth reading ["The Ninja: An Invented Tradition?"" by Stephen Turnbull](https://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/jgi/vol9/iss1/3/).

|0 | Volume 4 likes to jump around time wise to show concurrent events. |
|1 | Sometimes between panels, there is no way to tell that some time has passed. Or when some activities occur chronologically. |
|2 | Also, volume 4 reveals that Kamui went to the Dojo as part of his ninja training, meant that he was already at the Iga village before the end of volume 3 (i.e. v3 196 is v4 32). That is to say, during the Tamate revolt, Kamui was training with Akame.|
|3 | It might be useful to understand the [logogram 忍]({% post_url 2023-03-30-Perseverance %}).|
|4 | There are some continuity issues between volumes, but we don't talk about them. (i.e. Ryuunoshin is supposed to have missing fingers.)|
|5 | Whenever someone wears a headscarf, their identities are actually hidden. |
|6 | You can differentiate between the wandering monks by observing their Rakusu (絡子). However, there is only one monk ("Chief") wearing the full Wandering Monk garb in volume 4. |
|7 | [Genin]({% post_url 2023-03-30-Genin %}). is not a very easy translation to do. |
|8 | I don't really think the author really differentiates the terms Shinobi, Shinobi no mono, and Ninja. I think just calling all of them "ninja" would be good. |
|9 | However, there's really two kinds of Shinobi here. The ninja clan which Kamui is in, and Yokome. The Wandering monk ("Chief") recognizes Yokome to be someone who not only have potential to become a Shinobi, but also carries out activities that require him to do it stealthily (i.e Shinobi itte). |
|10 | I believe that there are times where Samurai doesn't really mean the social class, but to differentiate between them is difficult and would end up looking like it is arbitrarily made. |
|11 | Some other interesting stories that marginalize humans are `Shinsekai Yori`, `Shadows House` , `Eighty-Six`, `Gundam Iron Blood Orphans`.|
|12 | Reading from volume 1 really lets you further appreciate the criticism towards Japanese animators which Miyazaki Hayao (who has identified among the works which inspired him, Sanpei Shirato's works is one of them) utters in 2014 in an interview with Golden News (yes, that interview which prompted someone on the internet to post a picture of Miyazaki with the words "Anime is a mistake"). In that interview he says: "These people don’t observe nature enough, they just don’t see. Their drawings are not based on nature. The Japanese animation industry is mostly filled with Otakus who can’t stand looking at other humans. That is why there is a difference between our drawings." (You can google "日本のアニメは人間の観察が嫌いな人間がやってんだよ。だからオタクの巣になるんだよ" to find the screen capture.)|
|13| I believe the idea of crucifying prisoners was something that the Edo had is actually quite possible. However, I do not know if that idea was before or after the introduction of Christianity by the Europeans. After all, the method of crucifying shown is closer to how Second Lieutenant Adnan Saidi (Rest In Peace) was executed in 1942. |
|14 | To emphasis crucifying part, the type of crucifixion that Jesus of Nazareth (who is called Christ by some) was subjected to, generally involves the person staying alive much longer. Muscle failure, shock, asphyxiation, blood loss were generally the cause of death due to being left hanging on the tree. The crucifixion portrayed in Kamui-Den was stabbing a person (who is still clothed although the breasts are exposed) to death. |
|15 | Honestly, I find it interesting to look at the entirety of Kamui den volume 4 over again and reflect on Iroha Poem's words relative to the events happening in the story.|
|16 | If you believe that the Yakuza's traces to the Edo period is an invented tradition, it is worth nothing that the prisoners talk about Yakuza when Akame is leaving the prison. |
